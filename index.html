Streets are partially covered with fresh snow, footsteps visible on sidewalks. Few pedestrians walk calmly, wearing thick winter coats, knit hats, scarves, gloves, boots, mostly in neutral colors. Clean, well-maintained buildings with stone façades, sloped roofs, and large windows line the street. Trams move slowly along snow-dusted tracks. The soundscape is quiet and muffled, with soft ambient city noise. The lighting is cool and diffused, emphasizing a calm, serene Winter modo.</p>

Few pedestrians walk calmly, some holding umbrellas, wearing long wool coats, scarves, trench coats, leather shoes, and muted neutral colors. A cyclist passes by wearing a rain jacket. Haussmann-style buildings with cream stone façades, wrought-iron balconies, tall windows, and mansard roofs line the street. Café terraces are closed, chairs stacked neatly.

Streets are dusty in some areas, with patches of worn asphalt and concrete sidewalks. Pedestrians, mostly Black people, walk at a normal pace, wearing practical everyday clothing such as T-shirts, light shirts, jeans, skirts, and simple jackets, suited to mild morning temperatures. Some carry backpacks or bags. Low-rise commercial buildings, apartment blocks, and small street shops line the road, showing signs of daily use rather than perfection. Matatus, motorcycles, and cars move steadily through traffic, stopping frequently. Trees and sparse greenery appear along the streets, slightly dry. The soundscape includes engine noise, footsteps, quiet conversations, and distant city activity. The lighting is natural and flat, with soft shadows, emphasizing an ordinary, lived-in morning atmosphere.</p>

            Traditional rendering pipelines rely on complex assets, accurate materials and lighting, and substantial computational resources to produce realistic imagery, yet they still face challenges in scalability and realism for populated dynamic scenes.
            We present <strong>C2R (Coarse-to-Real)</strong>, a generative rendering framework that synthesizes real-style urban crowd videos from coarse 3D simulations. Our approach uses coarse 3D renderings to explicitly control scene layout, camera motion, and human trajectories, while a learned neural renderer generates realistic appearance, lighting, and fine-scale dynamics guided by text prompts.
          </p>
          <p>
            To overcome the lack of paired training data between coarse simulations and real videos, we adopt a two-phase mixed CG–real training strategy that learns a strong generative prior from large-scale real footage and introduces controllability through shared implicit spatio-temporal features across domains. The resulting system supports coarse-to-fine control, generalizes across diverse CG and game inputs, and produces temporally consistent, controllable, and realistic urban scene videos from minimal 3D input.

Foreground building is a long horizontal block with deep recessed horizontal bands. Background features vertical skyscrapers with simple grid geometry. Heavy rain falls steadily, creating reflections on dark asphalt and sidewalks. Moderate crowds move briskly, people holding umbrellas, some hurrying. Pedestrians wear dark trench coats, wool coats, suits, scarves, waterproof jackets, and leather shoes. Red double-decker buses and black taxis pass by. Modern and historic buildings mix together: glass office towers alongside stone façades with large windows. Streetlights and traffic signals glow warmly through the rain.

Two people enter from the lower-left foreground and walk forward side by side at a steady pace, while the camera smoothly follows behind them at pedestrian height, maintaining a stable forward-tracking motion. On the right side of the street, close to a building wall, two other people stand facing each other, actively talking and arguing with visible hand gestures and expressive body language. Pedestrians wear autumn clothing such as coats, jackets, dresses, scarves, and boots, suited to mild fall weather. Far ahead in the distance, another solitary person stands or walks slowly, appearing small due to depth and perspective. In the far background, framed between the buildings, the Eiffel Tower rises prominently on the skyline as a recognizable landmark. Human motion is natural and continuous, with realistic walking cycles and subtle gestures, while the camera movement remains smooth and stable. The scene is lit with soft natural daylight, clear depth, and balanced exposure, presented in a cinematic, photorealistic style with sharp details, clean textures, and no blur or visual artifacts.</p>

        <div class="content has-text-justified">
          <p>
            Our method is compatible with different coarsening levels of input signal. 
            On the left column we show results for very coarse signal, where our model inpaints many details. 
            On the right we show a mid-coarse geometry as input that already includes some fine details. 
            Our model successfully follows the richer input signal, generating a video with the corresponding geometry.

            Our model enables to turn a low-poly Roblox game video into real-style even though it has never been trained on any game video. It adds realism to the dynamics and appearance of the video and solves collision issues in the original video.

            We compare our results with a baseline trained with off-the-shelf ControlNet adaptor for Wan2.1. Our model yields more expressive videos, where both humans and scene exhibit more realistic appearance.
